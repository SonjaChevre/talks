## Abstract

OpenTelemetry, the project created from the merger of OpenTracing and OpenCensus is now three years old. If you had previously integrated OpenTracing or OpenCensus in your applications, you might be asking yourself: What will I gain from migrating to OpenTelemetry? Is OpenTelemetry tracing stable enough? What are the aspects to consider for a successful migration? After working for more than seven years in the observability space, I joined this year a new company and started to ask myself those exact questions. Join me on my learning journey as I look for answers.
